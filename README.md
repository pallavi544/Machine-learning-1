# Machine-learning-1
## About the Project
This project demonstrates a foundational machine learning workflow using a classification algorithm to predict outcomes based on input features. It walks through essential steps in a machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The goal is to provide hands-on experience in applying supervised learning techniques using Python.

## Objectives
* Understand the process of building a supervised ML model

* Practice data preprocessing techniques such as encoding and scaling

* Train and evaluate a classification algorithm

* Interpret performance metrics and visualize model outcomes

## Steps Covered
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handling missing values

* Encoding categorical variables

* Feature scaling

* Model Building

* Training a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression)

* Splitting data into training and test sets

* Model Evaluation

* Accuracy Score

* Confusion Matrix

* Classification Report

* Visualization of predictions

## Technologies Used
* Python – Programming language

* Pandas – Data manipulation

* NumPy – Numerical operations

* Scikit-learn (sklearn) – Machine learning library

* Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment
